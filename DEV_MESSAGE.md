# TIC_TAC_TOE-GAME
Hey Guyz...check out this simple project I worked on using Python . A brief attempt to #Pythonify TIC_TAC_TOE and make it available to all who are bored in their CSE classes and wanna kill their boredom. To play the game just follow three simple steps-->  Open A New File in Python IDLE >> Copy Paste The Code In The IDLE >> Run And Enjoy !!!

Moreover, I would encourage all the "Coders" out there to update the code as per their own interests. To make it much easier for you i am working on line by line explaination of my code and will be shortly uploading it here itself....stay tune. The code is written in basic python and i tried my best to keep it as simple as possible, no module other than time-module (only time.sleep()) is used in its development......so i guess it's a "Layman's Code". Also incase there is some issue/suggestion/query/grievance/etc don't be hesitant to reach out to us through email at : codraw.official@gmail.com
